Problem 07: Segmented Sieve

Implement a segmented sieve algorithm to find all primes in a given range [L, R].
"""


def segmented_sieve(L: int, R: int) -> list[int]:
    """
    Finds all prime numbers in the range [L, R] using a segmented sieve algorithm.

    The segmented sieve is an optimization of the Sieve of Eratosthenes for finding
    primes in a range. It first finds all primes up to sqrt(R), then uses them to
    mark composites in the [L, R] range.

    Args:
        L: The lower bound of the range (inclusive)
        R: The upper bound of the range (inclusive)

    Returns:
        A list of prime numbers in the range [L, R] in ascending order.
        Returns empty list if L > R or R < 2.

    Examples:
        segmented_sieve(10, 30) -> [11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
        segmented_sieve(100, 150) -> [101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149]
        segmented_sieve(1, 20) -> [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]

    return []

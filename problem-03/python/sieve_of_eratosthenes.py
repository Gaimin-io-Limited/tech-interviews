    Finds all prime numbers up to and including limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

    The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm for finding all primes up to any
    given limit. It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime as composite,
    starting from 2.

    Args:
        limit: The upper bound (inclusive) for finding primes

    Returns:
        A list of all prime numbers up to and including limit, in ascending order
